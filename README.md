# REST SERVER

REST Server application made with NodeJS + Express API.

Branch ``` main ``` is a simple rest server ready to receive GET, POST, PUT, DELETE request.

Branch ``` crud-rest ``` is a rest server with middlewares using ` Express-validator ` for validate url params / body params.
Crud rest have a `MongoDB` connection to save, update, delete and read users from DB.

If you want to use a crud-rest-server, remember write your enviroments variables, they are:

`PORT` -> Port of your application (Ej: 8081)
`MONGODB_CNN` -> Your MongoDB Url connection.

The tables are model with code, so, you don't need create manually any table in Mongo.

Recommend use `POSTMAN` for API's url validations.

## MODULES

Remember re-build with the command:

``` NPM INSTALL ```

## RUN APPLICATION

You can run this application with these commands:

`NODE APP`

`NODEMON APP`

Recocmmendable run the application with `NODEMON APP`, so, you don't need re-run app after made changes.

### ENJOY!
